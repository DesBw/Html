		<h2>Evaluating native Text Editors</h2>
	</header>
	
	<p>Whisk is a lightweight editor for HTML, PHP, CSS, and JavaScript development.</p>
	
	<p>Code written in the editor will immediately output to the preview pane. This instant feedback clarifies the effects of your changes making development more efficient.  It is great for learning web development, testing snippets of code, or building entire web pages.</p>
	
	<h2>Whisk has no autocomplete</h2>
	I was planning to use Whisk due to recommendations from reddit. Turns out, Whisk cannot autocomplete the tags. So, I looked around for other options. 
	
	<h2>CodeRunner seems better than Whisk</h2>
	CodeRunner has both the autocomplete feature, as well as the live preview of the html. For this, it is better than Whisk. 
	
	<h2>CodeRunner is better than Nova</h2>
		<ul type="disc"> <!-- bullet type: disc/square/circle-->
			<li>
	Nova is an expensive and popular text editor in the mac sphere. It has the code autocomplete and html preview. But, I couldn't find the way to run JavaScript within the editor. That is very strange. It seems to support JavaScript; but running the code seems impossible without going through some kind of hassle. 
			</li>
		<li>Another advantage of the CodeRunner is I can choose node.js as well as browser version within the app to run JavaScript code. So, I can use both <strong>console.log</strong> and <strong>alert</strong> functions</li>
		<li>It also has an option to use AI; google and stachexchange to find answers. I can search from the app directly. Tha</li>>
