      <h1>Pseudo-elements</h1>
      <blockquote>
        This need for connection is naturally understood by women. In mammals,
        parental care cannot be separated from lactation. During the 180 million
        years of mammalian evolution, females who responded to their offspring’s
        needs outreproduced those who were cold and distant. Having descended
        from a long line of mothers who nursed, fed, cleaned, carried,
        comforted, and defended their young, we should not be surprised by
        gender differences in human empathy. They appear well before
        socialization: The first sign of empathy—crying when another baby
        cries—is already more typical in girl babies than boy babies.
