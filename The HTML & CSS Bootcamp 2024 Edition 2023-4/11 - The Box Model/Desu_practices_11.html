        I used to go out every night. You never know, I would think. I used to
        go to every business meeting I was invited to. You never know, I would
        think. I used to go on TV every time I was asked. You never know, I
        would think. Maybe someone would SEE me. And call me and offer me and
        give me and want me and like me and love me. Maybe they would press the
        LIKE button on my face. Brilliant.

      <h2>London</h2>

        most populous city in the United Kingdom, with a metropolitan area of
        over 13 million inhabitants.

      If you want to be successful, you need to study success, not hate it or be
      envious of it. If you are
      <a href="http://www.example.com">example</a> envious, then you will
      distance yourself from success and make it that much harder to get there.
      Never be jealous. Never think someone is “lucky.” Luck is created by the
      prepared. Never think that someone is undeserving of the money they have.
      That only puts you one more step removed from the freedom you aspire to.

      Rejection—and the fear of rejection—is the biggest impediment we face to
      choosing ourselves. We can all put together books about all the times we
      are rejected. We’re rejected by lovers, by friends, by family, by the
      government, by the corporate world, by investors, partners, employees,
      publishers, and on and on.
