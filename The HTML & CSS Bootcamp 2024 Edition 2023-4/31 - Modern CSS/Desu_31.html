    <h2>Custom properties (CSS variables)</h2>
    <button class="but">Click me</button>
    <p>
      We have custom properties stored as variables to be used again and again.
      These are like templates; that we re-use them. I actually have this in my
      latex file where I defined a specific type of color: called it
      <span class="sp"><em>mycolor</em></span
      >, and use it in many pages by just calling by that name.

    <h2>The calc() function</h2>
    We can do basic operations of calculation inside css using calc function.
    <ol start="1" type="1">
      <li>addition</li>
      <li>subtraction</li>
      <li>multiplication *</li>
      <li>division</li>
    </ol>
