      <h2>A woman of substance</h2>
      A woman of substance surely wants to hear something profound about why she
      is loved—something specific about her character, mind, values, and way of
      approaching her career and life. This principle applies to both partners.
    </div>
    <div class="box" style="background-color: #ff9800">
      <h2>Cute woman</h2>
      example, if you tell a woman you fell in love with her because she’s cute
      and that’s it, nothing else, she probably isn’t going to feel flattered.
    </div>
    <div class="box" style="background-color: #ffc107">
      <h2>Massage and Sex</h2>
      If, for example, the woman feels that a massage inevitably leads to sex,
      she will avoid giving or receiving massages when she’s not in the mood.
      With a “non-demand” agreement, the wonderful massages or warm moments of
      intimacy will increase, some leading to sex, others enjoyed for their own
      sake. The decision to have sex is thus left open, depending on the
      ultimate moods of both partners.

      <h2>She comes first?</h2>
      <ol start="1" type="1">
        <!-- start: where to start counting;

      "1" for Arabic numbers 1, 2, 3

        <li>
          Separate orgasms, with the woman having her climax before or after
          actual intercourse. Either or both partners can stimulate the
          clitoris.
        </li>
        <li>
          Simultaneous orgasms, with the woman touching herself during
          intercourse (with her hand or by using a vibrator) to achieve orgasm.
        </li>
        <li>
          Simultaneous orgasms, with the man stimulating the woman’s clitoris
          with his hand before and during intercourse.

      <h2>The value of marriage</h2>
      A long-term relationship with a woman, such as marriage, is the most
      effective way for a man to add years to his life. The flip side of this
      picture is autism—an empathy disorder that keeps us from connecting with
      others—which is four times more common in males than females.

      <h2>Marriage</h2>
      "Woman, or more precisely put, perhaps, marriage, is the representative of
      life with which you are meant to come to terms." Franz Kafka <br />
      "Marriage is the hardest work you're ever going to do." Julie Andrews
      <br />
      "Marriage is a mistake every man should make." George Jessel <br />
      "Marriage is not about age; it's about finding the right person." Sophia
