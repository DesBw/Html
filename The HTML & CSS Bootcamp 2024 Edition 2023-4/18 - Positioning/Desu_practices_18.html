    <h1>Relative Positioning</h1>
    <p id="firstp">
      The position Property The position property specifies the type of
      positioning method used for an element. There are five different position
      values
    </p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <!-- bullet type: disc/square/circle/none-->
      <li>static</li>
      <li>relative</li>
      <li>fixed</li>
      <li>absolute</li>
      <li>sticky</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Elements are then positioned using the top, bottom, left, and right
      properties. However, these properties will not work unless the position
      property is set first. They also work differently depending on the
      position value.
    </p>
    <p id="secondp">
      HTML elements are positioned static by default. Static positioned elements
      are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties. An
      element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way; it is
      always positioned according to the normal flow of the page.
    </p>

    <h1>Absolute Positioning</h1>
    <p id="thirdp">
      elements of boxes are placed in absolute positions of their parent
      objects. The absolute placement is not to the root document; rather to the
      parent document to the point that the parent is positioned. If the parent
      is not positioned, it uses the root doc. - the parent is positioned
      (relative or absolute): the child flies with it. - the parent is not
      positioned, the child flies by itself.
    </p>
    <div class="box"></div>
    <div class="box secondb"><span>This is my small text</span></div>
    <div class="box"></div>
    <h1>A button</h1>
    <a href="#messages" class="btn"
      >messages
      <span style="" class="badge">3</span>
    </a>

    <h1>Fixed Position</h1>
    <p>
      These ones do work like the absolute in the sense that they place the
      object in relative to the root document. They differ from the absolute
      because the scroll doesn't move the object. It remains fixed in the
      position. I am going to move this little span.
      <span class="spn1">This little spanny text</span>
    </p>
