      If you want to be successful, you need to study success, not hate it or be
      envious of it. If you are
      <a href="http://www.example.com">example</a> envious, then you will
      distance yourself from success and make it that much harder to get there.
      Never be jealous. Never think someone is “lucky.” Luck is created by the
      prepared. Never think that someone is undeserving of the money they have.
      That only puts you one more step removed from the freedom you aspire to.

      Rejection—and the fear of rejection—is the biggest impediment we face to
      choosing ourselves. We can all put together books about all the times we
      are rejected. We’re rejected by lovers, by friends, by family, by the
      government, by the corporate world, by investors, partners, employees,
      publishers, and on and on.
